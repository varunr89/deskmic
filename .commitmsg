feat: working Settings tray item with auto-generated documented config

- Add Config::load_with_path() returning (Config, Option<PathBuf>) so the
  resolved config file path is available throughout the app
- Add Config::generate_default_commented() producing a fully-documented TOML
  config with all fields and inline comments explaining each setting
- Update main.rs to pass resolved config path to the recorder/tray
- Settings tray item now creates a default config beside the exe if missing
  and always opens it in Notepad
- Fix model path construction bug: resolve_model_path() handles absolute paths
  and .bin extensions without double-wrapping in ggml-{}.bin
- Add settings-feature implementation plan doc
- 10 new unit tests covering config loading, generation, and model path resolution

Closes #4
